# CARLA and Autoware Co-Simulation Guide

The guide will go through the steps to establish a multi-vehicle
simulation platform on CARLA, in which multiple Autoware agents can
cooperate on a single map. It allows the deployment of customized
Auotware for testing and does not restrict the version of Autoware
used.
